# refactoring-website-accessibility
# Horiseon code refactoring project

This project involved refactoring a website in order to increase the accessibility. This includes adding semantic html tags where applicable and adding alt tags to images and logos. It also involved consolidating and reducing the CSS.

# Challenges 
The main challenge I faced was deciding which tags were appropriate to use. I think I succeeded in this, though I still have a lot to learn about this process. Deciding the names for consolidated classes was difficult also. I moved items in the stylesheet around to reflect their order on the actual website. I did this as I felt it made the CSS more readable. The comments also helped with this.
 
 
# Things I learned

I learned a lot about HTML tags and semantics. I think I also gained some knowledge of how to organise a stylesheet.
